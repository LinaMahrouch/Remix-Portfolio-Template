This is a Remix based portfolio made with:
- [Remix.Run](https://remix.run)
- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/)
- [Headlessui](https://headlessui.com/)
- [Vercel For deployement](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/overview)

### Don't forget to run these commands:
```sh 
npm i remix-themes prismjs graphql graphql-request @graphcms/rich-text-react-renderer @headlessui/react
```

## Deployment

After having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a deployment target, you only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed.

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.
